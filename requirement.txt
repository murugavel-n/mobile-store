Goal:
Develop a mini online shopping website.
- Shopping cart and items integration
- Filtering and sorting 
- checkout page

Assumptions:
Consider day to day life items of your choice with dummy brands, prices and quantity.

Expectations:
1. User should be able to add/remove item(s) to shopping cart.
2  Items can be sorted on basis of their price, new arrivals(date in which they got added to inventory), discount in percentage, quantity(like in kg, grams or No.s). 
3. Design a filter panel as well. Use filtering criteria for price, discount, brand names etc.
4. Item can be dragged an dropped into shopping card directly or can removed by dragging out of the cart.
5. A checkout page should be designed which enlists all items in cart and accepts user details like name, email, phone, address as shipping details.

6. Modular code is expected.

Frameworks:
Feel free to use any JS/CSS framework in which you are comfortable.

Reference:
You may refer to any e-commerce site only as a reference for design. Use your imagination to enhance the page components further.
